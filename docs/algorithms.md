- **Linear regression** is a method for finding the straight line or hyperplane that best fits a set of points.

- **Naive Bayes** methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.

- **Decision Trees** are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
